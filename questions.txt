1. does it work with other oop programming languages to call a static method without instantiating an object?
2. I know we talked about this before but how does virutual methods work?
3. why do all public classes have to in the same file? what do you do if you want to be more organized and have classes in different file?
4. why does this need to be asbstract?
    public abstract MedicineSchedule getSchedule();
    can't we just make it without abstract so we wouldn't need to change the class's type to abstract?
5. at the end, you mentioned about about how to use reflection and it seems like it changes the program to dynamically typed for that block of code?
6. can reflection be done in C++ or python?
